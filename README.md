# enpm809F-project

This is a simple clinet-server implementation of the COAP protocol.

1) Install aiocoap and all other requirements. The easiest way to do this is by running `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
2) Start the server. `python3 ./server/server-main.py`
3) Start the client `python3 ./client/client.py ./client/RL`
    - The second parameter needs to be a folder of images.
